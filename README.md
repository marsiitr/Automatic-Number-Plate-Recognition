# Automatic-Number-Plate-Recognition
Srishti 2020

## ABSTRACT
Automatic Numper Plate Recognition system is a python based utility that captures live traffic, detects number plate of the oncoming vehicles and stores the data into a database.

## MOTIVATION
In this fast growing world, crime is increasing exponentially and that calls for better security and survellience in many sensitive and crowded areas like Colleges, Malls etc. Before the emergence of AI, record keeping had to be done manually which led to many human errors, and eventually led to security lapses. With the resources now at our hands, programs like ANPR become a necesity for the greater good of society.

So we took the project to design the above mentioned system, right from the source code to the body of this system.

## Mechanical Aspects of Design

### Structure
A box with 3 sliding doors, to hold the electronic components of the system. Easy to fabricate design, without the hassle of drilling, tapering and milling. Extruded cut in the front to fit the face of camera.

#### DIMENSIONS:
BOX :    x     x     (cm)

## Electric Aspects of Design 

### Microcontroller
Raspberry Pi 3B+ 

### Camera
LOGITECH WEBCAM 

### Battery
9 volt battery powering the pi with Micro USB 2.0 outlet

### Cost Structure

| Components       | Cost(INR.)     |
| ---------------- |:--------------:|
| Raspberry Pi     | 3830.00        |
| Battery          | 25.00          |
| LOGITECH WEBCAM  | 3500.00        |
| Total            | 7355.00        |

## Applications

Shopping Malls : To keep a record of vehicles entering

Toll Plaza : On highways for security reasons 

Parking Plazas : To detect and generate tax for parked vehicles automatically

Educational or Government Institutions : To ensure only authorized vehicles are permitted inside 

## Limitations

Restrictions on Camera's Field Of View , Resolution an Frame Rate .
A better OCR trained on strong GPU's will give better results .

## Future Improvement 

Developments in ML and DL can give more precise and accurate outputs .
Reduction in size of camera and microprocessor can save space .
